nirc-lib
========

Im creating this library as a learn project. It will be used by my [nirc](https://github.com/RolfKoenders/nirc) project. But if you like it you can use it for your own projects. 

## Development
Im currently looking into what would be a nice way to handle the parsing of the messages coming from the stream.

## Inspiration
I looked at allot of libraries but still wanted to create my own. I took allot of learnings out of @williamwicks library called 'irc-connect'. I really like the event driven pattern.
